        <h3>I am a full stack engineer, specializing in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
            Currently aspiring to become a data scientist and

        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <h2>"...Until I realized that truly nothing is impossible..."</h2>
        <h3>Prior to coding, I worked for many industries while balancing sports.
           None had ever seemed to create such a great passion. Although I was good in 
           sports I found myself doing it because others said I was good at it. I always loved
           tech but never had a structured class until I found Pursuit. Coding at first seemed 
           like only top geniuses could understand but then it clicked nothing is impossible.
